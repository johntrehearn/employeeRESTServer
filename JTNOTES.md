npm init -y

npm install express cors
(cross origin request server)

node index

means that the request is coming from a different server (different origin). This is why we need CORS (Cross Origin Request Server)

(prior to this in the Single Page Application we have been using the same server to send the request)

CORS is used for browser to server it is not needed for server to server connections. It is a security thing to prevent cross-origin attacks.

see REST Server on google (Wikapedia is good on this)
